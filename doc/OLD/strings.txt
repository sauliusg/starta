String constants:

"abc def" -- allocates string on the heap.
'abc def' -- allocates string on the static memory.

'A' -- character constant. How doe we distinguish it from a string?

Or like this:

"abc def" -- string on the static memory. Type is 'ref const string'.
To get allocate string, use one of the following:

var s : ref string;
var c : ref const string;
var s1 : string[100];

s :- "abc def".clone();
s := "abc def";
c :- "abc def";
s :- s.clone();
s1 := s;
s1 := "abc def";

s :- "abc def"; # This is an error, since "abc def" is 'ref const string',
                # and s is 'ref string'. If such assignments were allowed,
s[3] := 'A'     # one could afterwards write smomething like "s[3] := 'A'"
		# and in this way change the string constant.
