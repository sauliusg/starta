* Blob pack/unpack formats for string types

Blobs can contain the fllowing strings:

- 0-terminated strings (length is dynamic and determined during run
  time). Next string starts immediately after the 0-character.

- Fixed-length characters strings (character arrays) -- length is
  determined statically. 0-character terminator is ignored and
  processed in the same manner as any other symbol.

's' -- 1-byte character strings; locale/encoding unspecified.

'w' -- 2-byte character strings, chars little-endian; locale/encoding unspecified.
'W' -- 2-byte character strings, chars big-endian; locale/encoding unspecified.
'l' -- 4-byte character strings, chars little-endian; locale/encoding unspecified.
'L' -- 4-byte character strings, chars big-endian; locale/encoding unspecified.

'u' -- UTF8
'c' -- UCS16, chars little-endian;
'C' -- UCS16, chars big-endian;
'n' -- UCS32, chars little-endian;
'N' -- UCS32, chars big-endian;
