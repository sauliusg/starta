++ implement calls of super-class destructors (chained destructors);
++ suppers garbage collector calls from destructor allocations;
++ implement checks of destructor (and constructor) names;
++ port destructor implementation to all type representations;
-- check destructors for nested anonymous classes.
-- ??? think over, implement and check destructors for objects allocated in destructors themselves.
