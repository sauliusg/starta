This is SNAIL.

Snail is a language that sacrifices ortogonality of the HLC (see *HLC*) type
system for simplicity of the compiler.

The name "Snail" reflects the fact that this language has no ambitions to be
fast and optimisable; insted it tries to be simple (from compiler writer's
point of view) and correct.

Snail compiles to a threaded code over a pure stack machine.
