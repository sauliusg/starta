Type compatibility desiderata
=============================

Ideally, the notion of type compatibility should be as follows:

-- types_are_identical(t1,t2):

   this predicate is true when two type TNODEs describe exactely the
   same type:

   --- when t1 and t2 are pointer to the same TNODE (t1 == t2);

   --- when t1 and t2 are anonymous arrays of the same structure and
       with *identical* components;

   --- when t1 and t2 are anonymous structures with identical fields.

-- types_are_compatible(t1,t2):

   this prediate is true when the two types have compatible
   implementations.

-- types_are_assignment_compatible(t1,t2);

   this predicate is true when values of type t2 can (and may) be
   assigned to variables of t1.
