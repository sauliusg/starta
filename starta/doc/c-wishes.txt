What I would like to have in C

1. Garbage collections
2. Exception handling -- can be implemented without changing the language
3. Arrays that remember their size
4. Safe realloc()
5. Modules (namespaces)
6. Objects -- can be implemented as opaque pointers
7. Inheritance of interface
8. Inheritance of implementation (?)
9. Type-generic functions
